# Project: Soneto

## Project Description
A web application for runners to plan their routes ahead of running. It features a map where you
place markers along the intended route. A height curve is generated to visualize the elevation
changes along the route. The route can be saved, and exported as a GPX file.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js with React and Tailwind CSS
- Mapbox

## Code Conventions
- We use Prettier for code formatting.
- React components are written in functional components using hooks. We prefer regular functions accepting props and returning React.ReactNode over consts with React.FC
- 2 space indentation
- camelCase for variable names
- PascalCase for component names
- lower case for file names, with dashes between words

## Project Structure
- /app – Next.js app with pages and layouts
- /components – React components used throughout the app
- /hooks – custom React hooks
- /lib – business logic and utility functions

## Instructions for Claude
- Follow the code conventions already present in the project
- Prioritize readability over performance
- Write code in a functional style, using .map and .filter over loops
- Prefer immutable data structures and pure functions
- Write code in small increments, and avoid unnecessary premature abstractions
- Verify the code by running `tsc` and `npm run lint`, do NOT verify it by starting the application

## Enviroment setup
- Node.js v22+
- npm scripts:
  - `npm run dev`: Start the development server
  - `npm run build`: Build the production version of the app
  - `npm run lint`: Run ESLint to check code style
