# Project: Soneto

## Project Description

A web application for runners to plan their routes ahead of running. It features a map where you
place markers along the intended route. An elevation graph is generated to visualize the elevation
changes along the route. The route can be saved, and exported as a GPX file.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js v22+
- Next.js with React and Tailwind CSS
- Mapbox
- Recharts for data visualizations

## Code Conventions

- We use Prettier for code formatting.
- React components are written in functional components using hooks. Use regular functions accepting props and returning React.ReactNode over consts with React.FC
- camelCase for variable names
- PascalCase for component names
- lower case for file names, with dashes between words

## Project Structure

- /app – Next.js app with pages and layouts
- /components – React components used throughout the app
- /hooks – custom React hooks
- /lib – business logic and utility functions

## Instructions for Claude

- Follow the code conventions already present in the project
- Prioritize readability over performance
- Write code in a functional style, using .map and .filter over loops
- Prefer immutable data structures and pure functions
- When unsure about implementation details, requirements, or user preferences, ask questions instead of making assumptions

## Development commands

- `pnpm dev`: Start the development server
- `pnpm build`: Build the production version of the app
- `pnpm lint`: Run ESLint to check code style
